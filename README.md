Basic text-manipulation tools in Python, using jsonl as input.

Make a .jsonl file in Constellate, a service of JSTOR. You will need to extract it from the .gz file you download from the site. Then rename the jsonl file and put the same name inside the first code block of the notebook.
Make sure both jsonl and python files are in the same directory.
